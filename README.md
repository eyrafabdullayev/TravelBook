# TravelBook


## Info
When you are going to travel and if you would like to save your location this app will help you. \
You must just open the app and select 'new place' menu item. \
After that app shows you that where you are and then using long click over the map, you can add your location to the memory area. \
Then you will redirect to the main activity and in here you can see the places where you went. \
And using normal click over the item which you want to see, you will redirect to the map activity, in here you will see the place on the map.
